# Trace Anything

Shim and trace calls to absolutely anything.

Requires support for ES classes, ES Map, rest parameters, the spread operator,
and template strings.  This should work in all modern browsers (all browsers
whose names do not rhyme with Splinter-Wet Deplorer) and in nodejs.

Available via npm as `trace-anything`.
